    <h1>History of the Indian Army</h1>
    <div style="width: 80%; text-align: justify;">
    <P>The Indian Army has a rich and ancient legacy, with roots dating back over 5,000 years to early civilizations like the Indus Valley and later the Mauryan and Gupta empires, which maintained large standing armies. During the medieval period, powerful armies were maintained by empires like the Mughals and Marathas, showcasing advanced military organization and battlefield strategies.

The modern structure of the Indian Army began with the British East India Company in the 18th century, forming organized regiments of Indian soldiers, known as sepoys. Major events like the First War of Independence in 1857 (also called the Sepoy Mutiny) were led by Indian soldiers rebelling against British rule. After 1858, the British Crown took direct control of India, and the army was reorganized as the British Indian Army.</P></div>

      </div>
      <div style="width: 80%; text-align: justify;">


        <p>Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7, 2025, was a bold and swift Indian military response to the deadly
          terrorist attack in Pahalgam that claimed 26 civilian lives. The operation involved coordinated precision
          strikes on nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, using Rafale fighter jets, BrahMos
          missiles, drones, and artillery. India made it clear that only terror infrastructure linked to
          Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba was targeted, avoiding any harm to civilian or military assets. The
          success of the operation was widely praised across the country, with Parliament debating its impact and
          several states launching ‚ÄúSindoor Van‚Äù plantations in tribute to the armed forces. Operation Sindoor marked a
          significant moment in India‚Äôs fight against cross-border terrorism, demonstrating both strength and strategic
          restraint.</p>

        <p>Surgical Strikes (2016 & 2019) were decisive military operations conducted by India in response to terrorist
          attacks. In 2016, following the Uri attack where 19 Indian soldiers were killed, Indian Army commandos crossed
          the Line of Control and destroyed multiple terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation
          showcased India's capability and willingness to act against cross-border terrorism. In 2019, after the Pulwama
          suicide bombing that killed 40 CRPF personnel, India carried out an airstrike in Balakot, targeting a major
          Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp. Both strikes sent a strong message that India would not tolerate terrorism and
          would respond with precision and strength.</p>

        <p>The Kargil War, fought between India and Pakistan in 1999, stands as one of the most remarkable achievements
          of the Indian Army. Pakistani soldiers and militants had illegally occupied strategic peaks in the Kargil
          sector of Jammu & Kashmir. The Indian Army launched Operation Vijay to push back the intruders. Braving
          treacherous terrain, harsh weather, and enemy fire, Indian soldiers displayed unmatched courage and
          determination. After intense fighting, the Indian Army successfully recaptured all occupied posts. The victory
          demonstrated India‚Äôs military strength and strategic resolve. It also honored the supreme sacrifice of brave
          soldiers like Captain Vikram Batra and others who laid down their lives for the nation.</p>

        <p>The 1965 Indo-Pak War was fought over Kashmir, where India repelled Pakistani infiltrators and defended its
          territory despite heavy losses. In 1971, India supported East Pakistan‚Äôs liberation movement, leading to a
          swift and decisive victory. The war ended with Bangladesh becoming an independent nation. India‚Äôs military
          strength and strategic leadership were key in both wars.</p>

        <p>A field gun is a type of artillery designed to be mobile and used in battlefields for direct or indirect fire
          support. It typically has a long barrel for high-velocity shells, allowing it to hit distant targets with
          accuracy. Field guns played a crucial role in both World Wars and continue to be used in modern military
          operations. They are usually towed by vehicles or mounted on mobile platforms. Their powerful firepower makes
          them effective against enemy troops, bunkers, and light armored vehicles.</p>

    <h1>History of the Indian Air Force (IAF)</h1>
    <div style="width: 80%; text-align: justify;">
    <P>The Indian Air Force (IAF) was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary of the British Royal Air Force. It started with a small fleet of four Westland Wapiti biplanes and six Indian officers. During World War II, the IAF played a significant role in supporting Allied forces, especially in the Burma campaign against Japan, earning recognition and growth in strength and professionalism.

After India gained independence in 1947, the IAF became the air arm of the newly formed Republic of India. It was soon tested in the First Indo-Pak War (1947‚Äì48) over Kashmir, where it primarily provided transport and reconnaissance support. Over the years, the IAF modernized rapidly and played key roles in all major wars, including the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars, and the Kargil conflict (1999), where it used precision airstrikes in high-altitude warfare.</P></div>

    <h1>History of the Indian Navy</h1>
    <div style="width: 80%; text-align: justify;">
    <P>The Indian Navy traces its origins back to the ancient maritime traditions of India, with references to naval power in the Mauryan and Chola empires, which had powerful fleets for trade and warfare. The modern Indian Navy, however, began with the East India Company‚Äôs Marine in 1612, established to protect British merchant ships along the Indian coast.

By 1830, it was renamed the Indian Navy under British rule and later became the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) in 1934. During World War II, the RIN expanded rapidly and played an important role in escort missions and naval battles in the Indian Ocean.

After India gained independence in 1947, the navy was divided between India and Pakistan. On 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, the prefix "Royal" was dropped, and it became the Indian Navy. Since then, the Navy has played a vital role in major conflicts, including the 1971 Indo-Pak War, where it launched Operation Trident and Operation Python, successfully attacking Karachi harbor.</P></div>
