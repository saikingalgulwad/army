    <h1>ðŸ›• History of Indian Temples</h1>
    <div style="width: 80%; text-align: justify;">
    <P>The history of Indian temples dates back to around the 2nd century BCE, evolving from simple cave shrines into magnificent stone structures over centuries. Early temples were built during the Maurya and Gupta periods, followed by grand architectural styles like Nagara (North India), Dravidian (South India), and Vesara (Deccan region). These temples were not only places of worship but also centers of education, art, music, and culture. Over time, dynasties like the Cholas, Pallavas, Hoysalas, and Mughals influenced temple design and construction. Today, Indian temples stand as timeless symbols of the countryâ€™s spiritual heritage, architectural excellence, and rich cultural legacy.</P></div>
